# Welcome to ConnectUS!

ConnectUS is a **contact management system** that enables NUS School of Computing (SoC) students to better manage their contact information. Users can leverage on ConnectUS' **contact management system** to view and edit their contact information. The **tagging system** also helps users better organize their contact information according to their needs.

ConnectUS focuses on:
- **Efficiency**: Optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI), **easily view and edit contacts** with the **contact management system**.
- **User-friendliness**: With the benefits of having a Graphical User Interface (GUI), **users can easily navigate through contact information** to find exactly what they need to **connect** with others.

This Developer Guide provides an in-depth documentation on how ConnectUS is designed and implemented. It covers high-level details such as the architecture of ConnectUS, to detailed specifications on smaller pieces of the design such as how commands are implemented. It also includes a glossary for definitions of terms used in ConnectUS.

You can use this guide to help maintain, upgrade, and evolve ConnectUS.

# 2. How to Use the Developer Guide

Thank you for your interest in ConnectUS! We aim to provide you with all the information necessary to understand, maintain, upgrade, and evolve ConnectUS.

While you do not need to read the Developer Guide in a sequential order, we recommend going through the [Design](#3-design) section to get a high-level overview of ConnectUS before looking for information that concerns you.

## 2.1 Notation

Some special notations are used throughout this guide:

- [Links in blue](#21-notation) will help you navigate through this document, or take you to places on the Internet.
- **Bolded words** are phrases that you should pay attention to.
- <u>Underlined words</u> can be found in the [Glossary](#9-glossary).

## 2.2 Navigation

The Developer Guide has six main sections:

1. [Design](#3-design)
2. [Implementation](#4-implementation)
3. [Planned Enhancements](#5-planned-enhancements)
4. [Documentation, Testing, and Other Guides](#6-documentation-testing-and-other-guides)
5. [Instructions for Manual Testing](#7-instructions-for-manual-testing)
6. [Requirements](#8-requirements)

- If you are a **developer**, the first four sections will be most applicable to you. [Design](#3-design) gives you a high-level overview of how ConnectUS is structured, and information on the key components of ConnectUS. [Implementation](#4-implementation) addresses how the features in ConnectUS are implemented. [Planned Enhancements](#5-planned-enhancements) provides insights on known bugs and issues in the latest release of ConnectUS, and plans we have to address and fix these issues. Finally, [Documentation, Testing, and Other Guides](#6-documentation-testing-and-other-guides) provides guides on creating documentation, logging, testing, configuring, and DevOps for ConnectUS.

- If you are a **tester**, the [Instructions for Manual Testing](#7-instructions-for-manual-testing) will provide you with a guide for testing. It covers how to launch and shut down the application, as well as how to test some commands in ConnectUS.

- If you are in the **marketing or product team**, or are interested in knowing why ConnectUS was created, the [Requirements](#8-requirements) section addresses our [Product Scope](#81-product-scope), [User Stories](#82-user-stories), [Use Cases](#83-use-cases), and [Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)](#84-non-functional-requirements).

## 3.1 Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for:
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#36-common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#32-ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#33-logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#34-model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#35-storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above):

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

## 3.2 UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/connectus/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/connectus/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

## 3.3 Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/connectus/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images\LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `ConnectUsParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `ConnectUsParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `ConnectUsParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

## 3.4 Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/connectus/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in `ConnectUS`, which `Person` references. This allows `ConnectUS` to only require either one `Module` object, `CCA` object, `Major` object, or `Remark` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own tag type objects. It also ensures that no duplicate tags are created.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

## 3.5 Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/connectus/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `ConnectUsStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

## 3.6 Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.connectus.commons` package.

**API** : [`Commons.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/connectus/commons)

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

# 4. Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

## 4.1 Add Command

**Overview:**

The `add` command is used to create a new `Person` in ConnectUS with information fields specified by the user, namely the `Name`, `Phone`, `Email`, `Address`, `Birthday`, `Social Media` (i.e. Telegram, Instagram, WhatsApp), and [tags](https://ay2223s2-cs2103t-w15-1.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#59-tags) such as `Module`, `CCA`, `Major`, and `Remark` fields.

The format for the `add` command can be found [here](https://ay2223s2-cs2103t-w15-1.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#adding-a-person-add).

**Feature Details:**

1. The user specifies a name for the `Person` to be added. The user can optionally specify the `Phone`, `Email`, `Address`, `Birthday`, `Social Media`, and tags such as `Module`, `CCA`, `Major`, and `Remark` fields.
2. If the person name is not provided, or if invalid command arguments are provided, the user will be prompted to re-enter the command correctly via an error message. 
3. The `Person` is cross-referenced in the `Model` to check if it already exists. If it does, then an error is raised as feedback to the user.
4. If step 3 completes without exceptions, the new `Person` will be successfully added and stored inside the contact list.

The following activity diagram shows the logic of adding a `Person` into the contact list.

![AddCommandActivityDiagram](images/AddCommandActivityDiagram.png)

The sequence of the `add` command is as follows:

1. The command `add INPUT` is entered by the user (e.g. `add n/Jason`).
2. `Logic Manger` calls the `ConnectUsParser#parseCommand` with the `INPUT`.
3. `ConnectUsParser` parses the command word, creating an instance of `AddCommandParser` to `parse` the `informationFields` via the respective `ParserUtil` functions.
4. `AddCommandParser` creates the corresponding `Person` object. This `Person` object is taken as the input of a new `AddCommand` object created by `AddCommandParser`.
5. `Logic Manager` executes `AddCommand#execute`, adding the `Person` to the model through `AddCommand` calling `Model#addPerson`.
6. A `Command Result` is returned with the result of the execution.

If duplicate parameters are entered (e.g. `add n/Jason p/91234567 p/12345678`, where the phone parameter is entered twice), only the last instance, `p/12345678` will be taken.

The `AddCommandParser` creates the corresponding `Person` object, which is then taken as an input by the `AddCommand` object that it creates and returns. `Logic Manager` then runs `AddCommand`, which then adds the `Person` to the model.

The following sequence diagram shows how `add` works:

![AddCommandSequenceDiagram](images/AddCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

The following sequence diagram provides details on how the `informationFields` are being parsed:

![AddCommandParseInformationFieldsDiagram](images/AddCommandParseInformationFieldsDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

## 4.2 Edit Command

**Overview:**

The `edit` command is used to change the information of an existing `Person` in ConnectUS with the information fields specified by the user, namely the `Name`, `Phone`, `Email`, `Address`, `Birthday`, `Social Media` (i.e. Telegram, Instagram, WhatsApp), and `Birthday` fields.

The format for the `edit` command can be found [here](https://ay2223s2-cs2103t-w15-1.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#editing-a-person--edit).

**Feature Details:**

1. The user specifies a person index that represents a `Person` to be edited.
2. If a negative or zero index is provided, an error is thrown. The user is prompted to re-enter the command correctly.
3. At least one field to be edited must be provided. If no field is provided, an error is thrown. The user is prompted to re-enter the command correctly.
4. If the index is not in valid range of the contact list provided, an error is thrown. The user is prompted to re-enter the command correctly.
5. The `Person` is cross-referenced in the `Model` to check if it already exists. If it does, then an error is raised as feedback to the user.
6. If step 6 completes without exceptions, the new `Person` will be successfully edited and stored inside the contact list.

The following activity diagram shows the logic of editing an existing `Person` in the contact list.

![EditCommandActivityDiagram](images/EditCommandActivityDiagram.png)

The sequence of the `edit` command is as follows:

1. The command `edit INPUT` is entered by the user, where the `INPUT` is an integer index followed by fields to edit (e.g. `edit 1 n/John Doe`).
2. `Logic Manager` calls the `ConnectUsParser#parseCommand` with the given `INPUT`
3. `ConnectUsParser` parses the command word. creating an instance of `EditCommandParser` to `parse` the `informationFields` via the respective `ParserUtil` functions.
4. `EditCommandParser` creates the corresponding `EditPersonDescriptor` object. This `EditPersonDescriptor` object is taken as the input of a new `EditCommand` object created by `EditCommandParser`.
5. `Logic Manager` executes `EditPerson#execute`, creating a `Person` from the aforementioned`EditPersonDescriptor` object and adding this `Person` to the model through `Model#setPerson`.
6. `Model#updateFilteredPersonList` is called to update the list of `Person` objects.
7. A `Command Result` is returned with the result of the execution.

The following sequence diagram shows how `edit` works:
![EditCommandSequenceDiagram](images/EditCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

The following sequence diagram provides details on how the `informationFields` are being parsed by `ParserUtil`:

## 4.3 Delete Command

**Overview:**

**Feature Details:**

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

## 4.4 Help Command

**Overview:**

The `help` command provides the user with instructions on how to access the User Guide, or how to use a specified command.

**Feature Details:**

1. The user specifies a command that they need help with using `help` followed by the word needed to execute a particular command available in ConnectUS.
2. If a command is not specified, the help window with the URL to access the ConnectUS User Guide will be shown, as well as a general feedback message to denote successful execution of the command.
3. If a command is specified, the provided command is cross-referenced with all available commands in ConnectUS. If the command specified by the user does not exist, an error is thrown. A `help` feedback message with instructions on accessing `help` command with the User Guide will be shown.
4. The command usage instructions will be shown in the command feedback box. There will also be a message to denote successful execution of the `help` command.

The following activity diagram shows the logic of the `help` command.

# 5. Planned Enhancements

This section contains a list of known features that we plan to enhance in future iterations of the application.

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

## 5.1 Improve Edit Command

Currently, the edit command will not return the "Invalid Command Format" error message in the Command Result Feedback box. Instead, it states "At least one field to edit must be provided", which indirectly indicates that the command is of the correct format, when it is actually missing at least one information field to be edited.

The correct format should be: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [a/ADDRESS] [e/EMAIL] [ig/INSTAGRAM] [tg/TELEGRAM] [wa/WHATSAPP] [b/BIRTHDAY]`, where at least one of the optional fields is indicated.

## 5.2 Better Information Field Validation

Currently, certain information fields can hold values that would be considered invalid in real life. Some other information fields cannot hold values that would be considered valid in real life.

**Emails**: Based on the current [format constraints on valid emails](https://ay2223s2-cs2103t-w15-1.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#53-email-e), an email such as `jason@gmail` would be considered valid as it is:
* of the format local-part@domain, where
    * local-part contains only <u>alphanumeric</u> characters and these <u>special characters</u>:`+_.-`,
    * local-part does not start or end with any special characters,
* followed by a '@' and then a domain name, where the domain name
    * ends with a domain label at least 2 characters long,
    * starts and ends with alphanumeric characters,
    * consists of alphanumeric characters, separated only by hyphens, if any.

However, such an email would be considered invalid in real life, as they are of the following format: `local-part@domain.extension`, e.g. `jason@gmail.com`.

**Addresses**: Based on the current [format constraints on valid addresses](https://ay2223s2-cs2103t-w15-1.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#54-address-a), an address such as `;` would be considered valid as it:
* can take any value, and should not be blank.

However, such an address would be considered invalid in real life, as it would at least include a block number, street name, and a postal code.

**Instagram Usernames**: Based on the current [format constraints on valid Instagram usernames](https://ay2223s2-cs2103t-w15-1.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#55-instagram-ig), an Instagram username such as `john_doe` would be considered as invalid as:
* it contains the special character `_`, when it should only contain the special character `.`.

However, such an Instagram username would be considered valid in real life.

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

## 5.3 More Language Support

Currently, English is the only language that is supported by our application.

As we are aware that there are many international students studying in NUS SoC, we intend to add more language support (such as Chinese, French, Japanese, Korean etc.) so that international students can better enjoy our app!

## 5.4 More Social Media Support

Currently, only Instagram, Telegram and WhatsApp are supported.

As we are aware that some students studying in NUS SoC may have other forms of social media (such as WeChat, LinkedIn, Reddit etc.), and may want to add them to contacts, we are currently working on bringing this feature to you!

We plan to address and fix all the current constraints mentioned above in the next iteration of this product (V1.5).

## 5.5 Improve UI

There are some known issues with the current UI.

For example, our testers have noted that:
* The feedback box is too small, and is unable to show the full feedback message without long scrolling.
* The scroll bar sometimes jumps and changes in size randomly.
* There is an amount of space on the right side of the contact card that is not being utilized.

We plan to address and improve our UI in V1.6.

## 5.6 Improve Tag Deletion Command

Currently, the `delete-t` command can only delete tags one at a time. This may be inefficient if a users wants to delete multiple tags of differing tag types, especially if said user has contacts with many assigned tags.

We plan to address this constraint in the next iteration of this product (V1.5).

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

## 5.7 Improve Consistency of Command Feedback

Currently, executing certain commands may return inconsistent feedback. For example, if there is an index overflow, the feedback returned is "Invalid command format!", when it should be "The person index provided is invalid", as is when an invalid index is provided to command parsers.

We plan to address this constraint in the next iteration of this product (V1.5).

## 5.8 Removing of Optional Information Fields
