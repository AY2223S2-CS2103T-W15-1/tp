### Project: ConnectUS

ConnectUS is a desktop app for managing contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, ConnectUS can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.
